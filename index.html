The questions that follow are from the following fan-fiction passage written by me:<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
<br /></div>
<div style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in; text-indent: .5in;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It was a clear moonless
night in Kadesh, Egypt. I was on an errand for Ramses II, who was about to get
his [butt] wiped across the Nile by the Hittite forces. So of course I, The
Eternal Nightmare, decided to tip the scales a little.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in; text-indent: .5in;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I immediately located the
one of the enemy Hittite encampments on the valley-side. The lights of their
scattered campfires were tiny suns in the dead of the night. I pondered
why ever since ancient times, humans have always been afraid of the dark. I
could see just fine in the darkness, and the obnoxious light from the fires
seemed downright unnatural to me. Then again, my eyes have seen things past and future, while humans can only dream of things to come.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in; text-indent: .5in;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The guards that were currently on duty were staring around lugubriously, jealous of their comrades respite in slumber. Ironically, the enemy’s
fires probably made it much harder for them to see me, a swirling darkness,
circling around their camp. As for the real reason why I had decided to give
Ramses II a hand before the formidable Hittite army fell upon his precious city
like a flood, well… It was compensation for all the souls that I had feasted on
in his city. I had even eaten dreams from his favorite eunuch, a tall and well
built specimen. After all, I didn't want him to send his high priests after me;
I had a great disgust for all things holy, and the Egyptian high priests were
quite adept in their art, being empowered by whatever gods they worshiped. Not
that I couldn't take care of them if the time came.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in; text-indent: .5in;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The wind blowing around
the camp began to diminish, until all the campfires were perfectly still. In
the rest of the valley, it still howling and blowing. The air was unnaturally
still as the Hittites continued to sleep away. I counted how many guards they
put on post - one… two… All right, 6 plus one necromancer. Not a problem for
me, I’d have to go for the necromancer first, and hopefully the other 6 won’t
struggle too much before I finish them off.</span><br />

<div style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in; text-indent: .5in;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The cloud of darkness at
the edge of the camp took shape, and I materialized as a shadowy figure with
two nasty looking blades attached to my arms. The necromancer twisted his head like a cat's and stared in my direction with some uncertainty. [Darn], those magicians always
have surprisingly sharp senses.</span></div>
<div style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in; text-indent: .5in;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“Hey Sinop, do you feel
that?”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in; text-indent: .5in;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“Huh?”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in; text-indent: .5in;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“Wasn't there a headwind
blowing through here just a second ago? Kept taking off my hat. But the air
seems unnaturally still now.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in; text-indent: .5in;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“Who knows man, it’s
[freakin'] Egypt. I hate this place, don’t even know why the King wants us to
capture it. All I've seen of it’s ‘glorious wealth’ is sand, buildings made of
sand, and more sand.”</span></div>
<div style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in; text-indent: .5in;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I didn't want to hear
their housewife-like chatter anymore. Suddenly the light of the fires and the
stars were all snuffed out like candles; the air was as black as The Void. The
necromancer cursed and began chanting some strange words. I shot from the edge
of the camp with the speed of an arrow, and impaled the poor bloke through his
left eye and out the back of his head. The unnamed abominations that were being
summoned crumbled into nothingness like walls of old Mesopotamia.<o:p></o:p></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in; text-indent: .5in;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The other 6 soldiers, all
effectively blinded, were slow to act. I casually waved my hand and implanted
dark dreams in each one of their minds. It was so much easier to deal with this
common rabble. They all tried to raise the alarm - to no avail. Fear spread
through their minds like a poisonous fog, incapacitating their brains’ ability
to send signals to the rest of their bodies. As their eyes glazed over and they
groggily moved about like some weird species of snails, I feasted on their fear
and replenished my energy.<o:p></o:p></span><br />

<div style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in; text-indent: .5in;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The six hollow shells
soundlessly dropped to the ground. I flexed my arms and laughed as my
nightmares spread through the camp like wildfire.<o:p></o:p></span><br />

<div style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in; text-indent: .5in;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Suddenly though, I felt
like invisible constraints seized my entire body. Not good. I tried to move,
but was immobilized. Was it a group of elite Hittite magicians? Suddenly, a
voice came from everywhere and nowhere: “Congratulations, you have
been selected as one of the future champions for the League of Legends. We'll just have to put you in stasis for a while as we prepare the fields of justice
that you will be fighting on.”<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in; text-indent: .5in;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I had no idea what the
words meant, so I struggled more and felt the spell that was binding me loosen.
Whoever attacked me was going to regret it badly; my shroud of darkness has always made me temporarily immune to all magicians' magic, even the most powerful. I activated it and felt the bonds holding me nearly break.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in; text-indent: .5in;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">A heard the voice again,
it was laughing. The bonds became infinitely tighter. I struggled vainly and vaguely wondered who could achieve such a feat of binding me. D</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 150%;">arkness descended again, this time upon myself.</span></div>
